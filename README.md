# MachineLearning
This is the Repository for the Machine learning code for our project.

The project contains the follwing scripts. 

ClassDataSet: This class will import a portion or the entire data-set and apply different augmentation functions depending on the given input. At time of
writing, I dont have the time to specify what these are now, but they are clear in the code. 

ClassModel: This class will make a model object with different specifications depending on the input. 

Tests 0-5. These were needed for our project to test how hyper parameters affect the Validation and testing results.
